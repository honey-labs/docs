# NFTs in DeFi

NFTs can allow for increased circulation of liquidity, for example with liquidity pools. One of the biggest draw backs for staking liquidity in a pool is that investors no longer have access to staked or locked assets. However, if these assets can be mirrored through the use of NFTs. When a liquidity provider stakes X amount of ETH, they would receive an NFT which allows its holder to redeem X amount of ETH. Thus, liquidity providers can still trade the staked liquidity, by trading an ERC-721 token, which mirrors the value of it's underlying ERC-20 tokens. Interest and APRs from the staked liquidity would not directly go to the liquidity provider, but to whoever owns the NFT. This allows for the commoditisation of APRs and staked liquidity on our protocol.

To take this a step further, tokenisation of this exchanged liquidity allows us to build derivatives on top of this staked capital. This can be done, as it already exists in traditional finance, through credit default insurance. Additional risk, and thus higher returns can be layered on top of the underlying asset (liquidity staked in a pool) without affecting it.

NFTs can also be used to collateralise off-chain assets in DeFi. Our platform seeks to integrate the different protocols who finance off-chain assets into on-chain liquidity, such as [Centrifuge](https://centrifuge.io). Integrating securitisation protocols is key in order to layer NFT derivatives on top of DeFi.
