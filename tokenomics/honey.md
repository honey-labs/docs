## How to obtain HONEY

Honey can be earned by participating in liquidity mining. Half of all $HONEY liquidity mining goes to Honey Genesis NFT holders.

The remaining half of liquidity mining tokens are used to incentivise (through rewards) lending, borrowing, and liquidity providing.

## How to hold HONEY

Simply holding HONEY tokens in a wallet comes with high opportunity cost relative to veHONEY rewards. Longer term HONEY holders should vest tokens to veHONEY in order to participate in the DAO. The minimum [vesting period](vehoney.md) is 1 week and the maximum is 4 years.
