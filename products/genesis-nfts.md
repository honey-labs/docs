_\*NFT stakers receive the $HONEY token during a 2-year liquidity mining program, and can thus opt-in to any of the benefits of token stakers. This indirect benefit is labeled_ ✔️



## Liquidity Mining

Half of the entire protocol's liquidity mining program is allocated to Honey Genesis NFTs. This means the NFTs yield HONEY minted from the initial supply which can be vested for all of the veHONEY benefits.

If all NFTs are staked, maximum dilution would result in 10.27 $HONEY per day per NFT.

{% hint style="info" %}
[HIP#3](https://forum.honey.finance/t/hip-3-increased-allocation-of-honey-to-nft-holders/187) extended the previous 2-year liquidity mining program to continue with a yearly halving schedule. This means total yield per NFT is now \~ 11.25k instead of 7.5k $HONEY.
{% endhint %}

## Alpha program 🧪

Honey's alpha program is designed to make the Honey NFT holders the most innovative DAO in DeFi, by building and creating experimental features made accessible exclusively to Honey NFT holders.

* **Experimental yield vaults:** DeFi and arbitrage strategies can be created by the members
* **Airdrops:** New NFT experiments from the team (such as yield bearing NFTs, LP NFTs, veNFTs, and other financialised NFTs) are airdropped to members of the alpha program.

To enroll, you must hold an NFT and react with the 🧪 emoji in the welcome message on the [discord](https://discord.gg/honeydefi).

## Introduction

Those who mint our native NFTs will be able to earn our governance token in a 2 year liquidity mining program. During those 2 years, NFT stakers will earn up to half of the total liquidity mining incentives.

Mining $HONEY introduces NFT holders to a powerful form of DeFi governance, explained in our tokenomics.

Additionally, Genesis NFT holders will continue to earn value with NFT airdrops. These airdrops are financial experiments developed by Honey Labs and the community's brightest contributors. The airdrops can be activated by injecting liquidity, and will allow us to pioneer the financialisation of NFTs.

## FAQ

****\
**How do you use native NFTs ?**

You must first mint the NFT or buy it from the market, then stake it in our farms to receive $HONEY.

**What other NFTs can be staked ?**

Yes, we will occasionally partner with other collections for short term events in which other collections can be staked to receive $HONEY. Members from that community will thus become stakeholders in the protocol.\
\
Who we decide to partner with will depend on the DAO. The DAO can elect to have no other receive $HONEY, or many.

**What are these NFT airdrops ?**\
****\
****Honey is at the intersection of DeFi and NFTs, and our DAO aims to explore all of the interesting possibilities that lie in the financialisation of NFTs. This can be building yield generating NFTs, structured product NFTs, and much more.\
\
When community members offer an NFT experiment, it will be voted by NFT holders. If the strategy  passes and is created, the creator will earn 10% of all the revenue it generated, incentivising the community's brightest minds to create value for the NFT holders.
