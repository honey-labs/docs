# Honey P2P

**Honey P2P** is built as a **layer 2** application on top of Honey's core lending product. It is meant to drive [capital efficiency](https://docs.honey.finance/products/honey-p2p/refinancing#capital-efficiency) in the protocol by allowing lenders and borrowers to be matched in peer-to-peer (P2P) markets.

Just like any layer 2 application, it can exist on it's own and can thus be used as a normal peer-to-peer marketplace for loans.

Honey P2P focuses on supporting financial NFTs, such as options, derivatives, or complex liquidity positions. As a **permissionless** dapp, anybody can use it to collateralise any NFT and build **open source** use-cases on top of Honey P2P.
