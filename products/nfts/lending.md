# Lending

Lenders can supply supply liquidity to lending markets and earn interest on fees paid by borrowers. The interest paid by borrowers determines the supply APR, which is an interest rate on the assets supplied by lenders.

Liquidations serve to pay back the loans from borrowers and repay the lenders. Liquidations close open positions, which means lenders are paid back their principle + interest.

## Isolated Risk Markets

Each lending market on Honey lives in isolation. Risk is not carried over from one market to another, and if one suffers a cascade of liquidations, it will not affect the overall protocol.

Thus each lending market has a different risk profile, interest rate, and collateral type. Supplying liquidity as a lender means choosing which lending market has the most favorable parameters.

## Boosting APR

Supply APRs can be boosted with veHONEY. Delegating veHONEY to a lending market will allow lenders to boost APRs by as much as 20%. This boost percentage will be increased over time as the protocol develops network effects.

Honey Genesis NFTs can also be locked for veHONEY, allowing NFT holders to access higher yields on lending.
