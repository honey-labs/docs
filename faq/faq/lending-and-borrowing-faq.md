# Lending & Borrowing FAQ

### What is the grace period on Honey loans ?

Honey loans do not include any grace period for the borrower. If loans are not repaid in time, the borrower will be immediately liquidated.

This is to protect the solvency of our lending markets, ensuring that lenders always have ready access to the liquidity they deposit in the protocol.

The Honey DAO and its token holders do not take any of the risk at any moment during the loan, and simply serve to match lenders with borrowers, thus they do not hold on to collateral or risk during grace periods.
