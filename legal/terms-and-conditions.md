&#x20;

The loss of credentials will result in the loss of the Tokens. Good practices advise Buyers to store their credentials securely in one or more backup locations that are geographically separated from the work location.

&#x20;

Any third party that obtains access to the Buyer’s credentials or private keys may be able to use the Buyer’s Tokens. To minimize this risk, Buyers must protect themselves against people gaining unauthorised access to their electronic devices.

&#x20;

Risks Associated with the Solana blockchain

&#x20;

Tokens are based on the Solana blockchain. Therefore, any malfunction, unplanned function or unexpected operation of the Solana blockchain may cause the Protocol or Tokens to malfunction or operate in a way that is not expected. SOL may itself lose value in a similar way to Tokens, and also in other ways.

&#x20;

Legal risk and risk of adverse regulatory intervention in one or more jurisdictions

&#x20;

DLT technologies have been reviewed by various regulatory bodies around the world.

&#x20;

The operation of the Protocol and of Tokens may be impacted by the passing of restrictive laws, the publication of restrictive or negative opinions, the issuing of injunctions by national regulators, the initiation of regulatory actions or investigations, including but not limited to restrictions on the use or ownership of digital tokens such as Tokens, which may prevent or limit the development of the Protocol.

&#x20;

Given the lack of cryptocurrency qualifications in most countries, each Buyer is strongly advised to carry out a legal and tax analysis concerning the purchase and ownership of Tokens according to the laws applicable to their nationality and place of residence.

&#x20;

Risk of an alternative, unofficial ecosystem

&#x20;

Following development of the original version of the Protocol, the official Protocol may find itself in competition with alternatives, unofficial protocols, which could potentially adversely impact the Protocol and Tokens.

&#x20;

Risk of a lack of interest in the Protocol or distributed applications

&#x20;

There is a possibility that the Protocol may not be used by a large number of individuals and other organizations, and that there may be a limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed applications. Such a possible lack of interest could eventually impact on the development of the Protocol and, therefore, on the uses or potential value of Tokens.

&#x20;

Risk that the Protocol is not developed

&#x20;

The rights associated with Tokens are exclusively limited, in their scope, to the Protocol. The value of the Tokens is therefore heavily correlated with the existence of such Protocol. Tokens may lose part or all of their value if the Protocol is never fully developed.

&#x20;

Risk that the Protocol, as developed, does not meet user expectations

&#x20;

The Protocol is currently under development and may undergo significant redesign prior to its full launch. For several reasons, not all user expectations concerning the Protocol or Tokens’ form and function may be met on the launch date, including changes in design, implementation, and execution of the Protocol.

&#x20;

Risk of theft and piracy

&#x20;

Hackers or other malicious or criminal groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Protocol or the availability of Tokens in several ways including, but not limited to, denial of service attacks, Sybil attacks, mystification, surfing, malware attacks, or consensus-based attacks.

&#x20;

Risk of security weaknesses in the Protocol’s core infrastructure software

&#x20;

There is a risk that the Seller team, or other third parties, may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructure elements of the Protocol, by interfering with the use of, or causing loss of, Tokens.

&#x20;

Risk of weakness or exploitable breakthrough in the field of cryptography

&#x20;

Advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, may present risks for cryptocurrencies and the Protocol, which could result in the theft or loss of Tokens.

&#x20;

Risk of the Protocol failing to be used or adopted

&#x20;

While Tokens shall not be considered an investment, their value is bound to change over time. This value may be limited if the Protocol is not sufficiently used and adopted. In such a case, there could be few or no markets at the Protocol launch, which would limit the value of Tokens.

&#x20;

Risk of a tight market for Token

&#x20;

There are currently few exchanges or trading facilities on which Tokens can be traded. Such exchanges or trading facilities will probably be relatively new and subject to poorly understood regulatory oversight. They may therefore be more vulnerable to fraud and default than the established and regulated exchanges that exist for other products. Should exchanges or trading facilities that represent a substantial part of the Tokens trading volume be involved in fraud, security failures or other operational problems, the failures of such exchanges or trading facilities may limit the Tokens value or liquidity.

&#x20;

Liquidity Risk

&#x20;

There is no assurance that a secondary market will develop and that the holders will be able to sell their Tokens.

&#x20;

Risk of an uninsured loss

&#x20;

Unlike bank accounts or accounts in other regulated financial institutions, funds held through the Seller or Solana blockchain are generally uninsured. At present, there are no public or private insurance agents providing Buyers with coverage against a loss of Tokens or a loss of value.

&#x20;

Risk of malfunction in the Protocol

&#x20;

The Protocol may be impacted by an adverse malfunction including, but not limited to, a malfunction that results in the loss of Tokens or market information.

&#x20;

Unforeseen risks

&#x20;

Cryptocurrencies and cryptographic tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks stipulated above, there are other risks that cannot be predicted. Risks may also arise out of and/or occur as unanticipated combinations or as changes in the risks stipulated herein.

&#x20;

If you are in any doubt as to the action you should take and the consequences it will involve, please consider consulting your legal, financial, tax or other professional advisor(s) for necessary advice.
