### Repay partially

You can repay part of your debt in order to bring down your risk level and avoid liquidation.

On the repay form, the slider adds SOL to your position. As you slide it, you will notice the values on the right side change, giving you a preview of what your loan will look like if you confirm the repayment.\


### Repay in full

To fully repay your loan, and withdraw collateral, click on the `100%` at the right of the slider, or bring the slider all the way to the right.\

This will bring your risk level back to 0%, allowing you to withdraw the NFT. Click the `REPAY` button, and approve the wallet transactions.\
\
Once the transaction has gone through, you will see a `CLAIM NFT` button. Click it to receive the NFT you originally deposited back into your wallet.\
