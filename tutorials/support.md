# Support

Users can choose below the area in which they need help, and fill in the information required and our Moderators can assist with any issues. \
\
Along with this our Development and Core team also assist with the support process to strive towards feed-back driven development.\
\
This is the process where our development team directly integrates the issues brought up in our tickets into their development cycle. Users, therefore , have a more direct impact on fixing bugs and UI/UX. \
\
Our support system is accessible to anyone on our discord, even without roles!\
