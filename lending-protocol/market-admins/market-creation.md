# Market creation

Anybody with a certain amount veHONEY can spin up a lending market for any given NFT collection.

**Requirements for listing:**

* Market admin must hold at least 50k veHONEY
* NFT collection must use [metaplex standard](https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/token-metadata/token-standard)
* Collection must have a Switchboard oracle

Most fields in the market creation are mutable, and be changed at a later date.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Market admins have full control over their markets and their oracles. This means market admins could act maliciously resulting in the loss of user funds. Please be careful when using unverified markets on Honey Finance.
{% endhint %}
