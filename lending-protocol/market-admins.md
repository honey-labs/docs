# Market admins

Market admins are tasked with creating lending markets for NFT collections.

Each lending market has to be approved by the DAO with veHONEY. New markets can be added each week, and market parameters must be approved alongside the proposed collateral type (NFT collection).

## Admin fees

Market admins can institute fees of up to 10% in their lending markets. This fee is paid from the interest paid by lenders, or during liquidations. Admin fees are deducted after protocol fees, which are at 10%.

_Example: With a 5% admin fee, if 1000 USDC is paid by borrowers in interest, the protocol fee will first take 10%, then the admin fee will charge 5% of what is left. In this market, lenders receive 85.5% of what borrowers pay in interest._
